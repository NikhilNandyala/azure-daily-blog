## Goal

This document outlines a recent shift in ExpressRoute architecture to improve **scalability**, **segmentation**, and **high availability (HA)**. The previous design had several technical limitations that became bottlenecks as the cloud footprint expanded.

---

# Previous Topology

The legacy ExpressRoute configuration was built using:

- **Standard SKU ExpressRoute circuit**
- A **single Virtual Network Gateway (VNG)** in the **Hub VNet**
- Spoke VNets peered to the hub for ER access
- No Global Reach or cross-region BCDR

**Limitations Observed:**

- **Prefix limits** exceeded during routing updates (max 10,000 for Standard SKU)
- Lack of **regional segmentation** â€“ one blast radius for all apps
- No **Global Reach** â€“ cross-geo traffic routed inefficiently via VPN/Internet
- **Throughput constraints** due to shared VNG and circuit

---

## New Design Highlights

The revised architecture leverages:

- **Premium SKU** ExpressRoute Circuit
- Dedicated **VNG per region** (or per functional Hub)
- Enabled **ExpressRoute Global Reach** for east-west BCDR
- Segmented VNets by workload/region via **multiple peering domains**

## Technical Changes Implemented

| Change                   | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circuit Upgrade**      | Upgraded ER from **Standard to Premium** to lift prefix limits and allow Global Reach |
| **VNG Redesign**         | Created multiple ER Gateways in separate Hubs (regional or functional)                |
| **Peering Model**        | Implemented dual-peering strategy per environment                                     |
| **Route Filtering**      | Enabled to control learned prefixes                                                   |
| **Traffic Segmentation** | Used **UDRs** and **NVAs** to route regionally and isolate workloads                  |

## Sample Change Log Entry

```
Change ID: CHG-AZR-ER-2025-07
Date: 2025-07-15
Summary: ER Circuit upgrade + Hub redesign for segmentation and HA
Action:
- Upgraded ER circuit to Premium
- Deployed new ER GW in Central US
- Connected 3 spoke VNets using regional hub
- Enabled Global Reach with East US circuit
Impact: Improved BCDR and removed prefix limit error observed during routing updates
```

---

## Risk Mitigation Steps

- **Staged Deployment**: Implemented regional hub design incrementally
- **Backout Plan**: Preserved previous ER circuit until routing validation completed
- **Prefix Review**: Analyzed BGP route tables before rollout to avoid blackholing
- **Monitoring**: Enabled NPM, Log Analytics for route and latency tracking

## PowerShell Validation Script

```powershell
# Get ExpressRoute Circuit Details
$circuit = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ResourceGroupName "rg-network" -Name "er-circuit-premium"
$circuit | Format-List Name,ServiceProviderProperties,BandwidthInMbps,PeeringLocation,Sku

# List all Peerings
Get-AzExpressRouteCircuitPeering -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit

# Validate Peering Connection Status
$circuit.Peerings | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Peering: $($_.PeeringType) | State: $($_.State) | AzureASN: $($_.AzureASN)"
}

# Get associated VNet Gateway and Connections
$vng = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName "rg-network" -Name "er-gw-central"
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $vng | Format-Table Name,ConnectionType,ConnectionStatus
